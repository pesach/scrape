### Dashboard Controls

#### Fetching Pending Links

You have **three ways** to fetch pending links:

1. **Individual Fetch** (Manual Click):
   - Each pending link has a blue "Fetch" button
   - Click the button to fetch that specific link
   - The button changes to "Fetching..." with a spinner during the process
   - Once complete, the status updates to "Completed" or "Failed"

2. **Fetch All Pending**:
   - Click the "‚ö° Fetch All Pending" button at the top
   - This will automatically fetch all pending links sequentially
   - Each link will be processed with a small delay to avoid overwhelming servers

3. **Retry Failed**:
   - Failed links show an orange "Retry" button
   - Click to retry fetching that specific link

#### Managing Links

- **Add New Link**: 
  - Click "‚ûï Add New Link" button
  - Enter the URL in the modal
  - Press Enter or click "Add Link"

- **Remove Link**:
  - Each link has a red "Remove" button
  - Click to delete the link from the queue

- **Clear Completed**:
  - Click "üóëÔ∏è Clear Completed" to remove all successfully fetched links

- **Filter Links**:
  - Use the filter buttons to view specific status types
  - Options: All, Pending, Fetching, Completed, Failed

#### Dashboard Information

Each link displays:
- **URL**: The link to be fetched
